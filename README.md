## ⚙️ Developer Tooling & Automation
*Standardized configs to ensure code runs on all machines instantly.*

### 1. Notebook Standards & The "Golden" YAML
**Primary Directive:** Quarto (`.qmd`) is the required notebook format for this project. Unlike standard `.Rmd` or `.ipynb` files, `.qmd` provides a unified engine that supports both R and Python seamlessly. 

The YAML header below is configured to be **polyglot-friendly**. It ensures that whether the notebook uses the `knitr` engine (R) or the `jupyter` engine (Python), the HTML and PDF outputs remain identical in professional formatting and functionality.

Copy this into the top of every `.qmd` file:

### 2. Efficiency Shortcuts
* **Track Changes:** View the real-time [Audit Trail](../../commits/main) of model edits.
* **Task Management:** Assign work and track progress via [Milestones](../../milestones).
* **Reproducibility:** Always use `here::here()` for data paths.
