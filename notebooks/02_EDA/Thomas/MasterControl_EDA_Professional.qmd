# 🎓 Phase 1: Business Understanding

## 1.1 The Client: MasterControl
MasterControl provides software solutions for the **Life Sciences** industry (Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices). Their clients operate in high-stakes, regulated environments where compliance is mandatory.

## 1.2 The Business Problem
We are analyzing a performance gap between two product lines:
1.  **Qx (Quality Excellence):** The legacy product. Converts at **~19.7%**.
2.  **Mx (Manufacturing Excellence):** The new product. Converts at **~12.7%**.

**The Objective:** The 7.0% performance gap suggests a targeting misalignment. Following the **CRISP-DM** lifecycle (learned in MKTG 6487), our goal in this EDA phase is to understand the data structure and identify features that differentiate successful Mx leads from failed ones.

# 🛠️ Phase 2: Data Preparation

We utilize **Python** (pandas, numpy) for data manipulation, leveraging skills from **IS 6493**.
