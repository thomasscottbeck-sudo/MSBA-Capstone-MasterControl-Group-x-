|------|----------|--------|--------|
| 2026-01-22 | Does your current sales process distinguish between "Capital-Dense" industries (Pharma/Bio) and "Capital-Light" industries (General Mfg)? Should we lower the employee count threshold for Pharma/Bio leads (e.g., to 50) in our scoring model? | Pending | |
| 2026-01-22 | Regarding the "Large" Tier (>2,000 employees): Conversion is low (10.6%). Is this because they build in-house, or because the sales cycle is longer than our 2-year data window? | Pending | |
| 2026-01-22 | What is the "Other" Tier (213 records, 3.3% conversion)? Can we safely exclude these from the "Golden List"? | Pending | |
| 2026-01-22 | What specific vendors make up "External Demand Gen" (2.5% conversion)? Is this content syndication or lead purchasing? | Pending | |
| 2026-01-22 | Why is "P1 - Webinar Demo" labeled "Priority 1" when it converts at only 6.6% (worse than "No Priority")? Is webinar viewing actually a low-intent signal? | Pending | |
| 2026-01-22 | Can you confirm if an "Operations Director" is a *stronger* signal for Mx than a "Quality Director"? We want to explicitly reward "Ops" titles for Mx leads if that aligns with your experience. | Pending | |
| 2026-01-22 | Why do "Non-Manufacturing Organizations" convert so well (32.6%)? Are these consultants/partners implementing MasterControl for others? | Pending | |
| 2026-01-22 | What is the most common reason a "Perfect on Paper" lead gets sent to Recycle? (A) No Budget, (B) Bad Timing, or (C) Ghosting? | Pending | |
| 2026-01-22 | Do "Recycled" leads ever come back? Our data shows repeat contacts convert significantly worse (13%) than first-touch leads (19%). Does this match your intuition? | Pending | |
| 2026-01-22 | Regarding APAC performance: Is the lower conversion rate due to product fit (regulations), or is it a sales resource issue? | Pending | |
| 2026-01-22 | Do you currently use any 3rd-party enrichment tools (ZoomInfo, Clearbit) to augment this data? (We see many "Unknown" manufacturing models with 1.1% conversion). | Pending | |
